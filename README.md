RESTClient is a Java application to test RESTful webservices. It can be used to test variety of HTTP communications. There are two executables:

* GUI version (restclient-ui-X.jar download)
* Cli version for batch execution of .rcq files (restclient-cli-X.jar download)


This is a clone with some enhancements iÂ´m woring on.
